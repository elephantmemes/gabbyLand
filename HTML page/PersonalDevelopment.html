<dl>
	<dt><li><b>Dedication & Focus</b></li></dt>
	
	<br><dd>The first strength that I possess is being a dedicated and focused individual. To be dedicated is to be devoted to
	
	a particular task or goal and ensuring that it is completed whether in the long or short term run. This is considered as one 
	
	of my strengths because I am always focused on getting my work done or even being focusd on what goal I would like to achieve. 
	
	<br>In the past few years I believe I have been developing on this strength because as I get older I become even more focused and driven 
	
	to achieve or complete a task given to me.</br></dd></br>
	
	<br></br>

	
	<dt><li><b>Time Management</b></li></dt>
	
	<br><dd>This can be considered as one of the attributes/ strengths that a person should have so that they can be able to balanace their time wisely.
	
	As such this has been one of my strengts for a very long time as I had to balance time with friends, school and also work while ensuring that
	
	each aspect of my life received the right amount of attention. <br><br> My time management skills has grown considerably in the last three to five 
	
	years because as I progress further along in life it becomes more challenging and more work is being given which would require me to properly
	
	manage my time.</br></br></dd>
	</br>
	
	
	<dt><li><b>Team Leader</b></li></dt>
	<br><dd><q>In order to lead a team one has to first know what exactly it takes to be a leader.</q> There has been countless times in which I was
	
	placed as the group leader whether verbally appointed by other students or I would automatically take on this role so that work could be done
	
	both efficiently and effectively. <br>As a result of this I recognized it as one ofmy strengths because I was good at leading groups whether
	
	it was for school or even church.</br><br>This strength along with the other two listed above has also developed because the more I was placed 
	
	as a group leader, the more I realized what is expected of me and what characteristics it takes to be a group leader. This may include being
	
	dependable, honest amnd etc.</br></dd></br>

<i><font color="white"><h2 align="center">Summary Of Twelve Pillars</h2></font></i>

<br></br>

<h3 align="center">Goals {Chapter 4}</h3>

<p>The summary of this chapter is that in order to achieve your goal you have to write it down because it means you have a goal and when it is written 

you are more likely to achieve these goals. Setting a goal is also not just about you achieving the goal but you becoming a better person after 

achieving.</p>

<br><h3 align="center">Proper Use Of Time {Chapter 5}</h3></br>

	<p>For this chapter when summarized it speaks on the fact that perosns should ensure they spend their days wisley because there is two types of pain you

	can experience; the pain of discipline or the pain of regret however the pain of regret outweighs the pain of discipline. The chapter also spoke about 
	
	ensuring that you dream and make these dreams become a reality. The last few things mentioned in the chapter is that you should not spend your time 
	
	focusing on the urgent matters but instead the important ones while also learning to balance and control your time so that it does not control you.</p>


<br><h3 align="center">Surround Yourself With Best People {Chapter 6}</h3></br>

	<p>This chapter says that you should surround yourself with people that will help you become the best verison of yourself because the persons you 
	
	are around have a vast amount of influence on the person you are and will become. It also spoke about figuring out what amount of time you spend with 
	
	each person and knowing if this time spent will allow you to grow. Another thing this chapter mentioned is that in order to attract persons you want 
	
	in your group you should also posses those attitudes whether it is being smart, powerful, etc. </p>


<br><h3 align="center">Be a Life Long Learner {Chapter 7}</h3></br>
	
	<p>The last chapter read mentioned the importance of self-education. The summary of this chapter is that even though formal education id beneficial, 
	
	self education is the key to living a proper successful life. Self- education is what you teach yourself as you get older and experience different things in life. 
	
	It involves observing successful people, learning from your mistakes or life experiences and also reading books.</p>


<br><h3 align="center">Application of Chapters in My Life</h3></br>
	<p>After reading through the various chapters, I have seen how each chapter could be applied to my life starting from the chapter <q>Goals</q>
	
	to <q>Proper Use of Time</q> then onto <q>Surrounding Myself Around Best People</q> and lastly <q>Being a Life Long Learner.</q>


	<p>For me I would ensure that for the various goals I want to achieve I would write them down while also ensuring that I use my time wisely and not
	
	to focus on just the urgent thing sbut also the important ones. The last two chapters coul also be applied to my life because if I start to analyze 
	
	who I associate with and place them in the different categories as stated in chapter 6, I would know who has a positive or negative affect on me.
	
	In order to apply the last chapter to my life, I would need to start observing other successful persons while also getting to knowledge from booking
	
	and learning from my experiences. </p>
